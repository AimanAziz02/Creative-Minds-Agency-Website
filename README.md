Title: Creative-Minds-Agency-Website
Description:
A sleek, responsive website created for the design agency "Creative Minds," showcasing their services, portfolio, and contact information. The project utilized Git and GitHub for collaborative version control, allowing us to efficiently manage and track code changes across branches.
Instructions to Run the Project
1.	Repository Cloning:
We began by cloning the GitHub repository onto our local systems using the git clone command. This allowed us both to have a local copy of the project to work on.
2.	Initializing Git:
After cloning the repository, we initialized Git in the project folder with the git init command, preparing it to track all changes we would make.
3.	Branch Creation for Team Collaboration:
To streamline our workflow, we created separate branches named Aiman and Batool, so each of us could work independently on assigned tasks. This branching structure helped prevent conflicts by allowing us to make changes in isolation.
4.	Switching to Our Respective Branches:
We then switched to our branches (Aiman and Batool) to start working on our designated tasks. 
5.	Adding Project Files and Content:
o	In the Aiman branch, we added and modified the index.html and style.css files to establish the structure and styling for the website.
o	In the Batool branch, we added the JavaScript file (script.js) to manage interactivity and an assets folder to organize images and other media.
6.	Committing Changes with Descriptive Messages:
For each update, we created commits with clear, descriptive messages, such as "Add HTML structure for homepage" and "Add CSS styling for homepage layout." These messages allowed us to keep track of specific changes made at each step.
7.	Pushing Changes to Respective Branches on GitHub:
After working on our branches, we pushed the changes to GitHub. Each branch was pushed separately to maintain the structure and allow for review before merging.
8.	Merging into the Main Branch:
Once we completed our tasks, we switched to the main branch and merged both Aiman and Batool branches. This process combined all our work into a single, unified version of the project.
9.	Final Push of the Merged Code:
Finally, we pushed the main branch with all merged code to GitHub, completing the project setup and ensuring the latest version was accessible for future development or review.
